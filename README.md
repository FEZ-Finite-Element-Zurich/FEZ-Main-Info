# FEZ (Finite Element Zurich) Roadmap

Vision Statement
- 

Our vision is to create a virtual hub to share modeling workflows for finite element analysis (a modeling method used in biomechanics research). Our website will serve as a place to learn methods (including open access alternatives to commercial software) and form collaborations. The main goal is to form a finite element analysis community across various institutions and disciplines, and to increase access to this modeling methodology. 

**Project is in Progress**

If you are interested in contributing workflows for any stage of the finite element modeling process (including creating initial 3D models), please contact me!

The current plan is to create a website and then link workflows on this website. Workflows will be added on Github by contributors (as Markdown files or by uploading PDFs.)

Ideas for contributing via Github:
If you want people to be able to make changes to your protocol, please upload as Markdown (.md) file. If not, please upload a PDF of your workflow.
